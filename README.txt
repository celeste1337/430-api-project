This is a website for people (mostly, entirely me) to keep track of their closet. 
I was inspired by some spreadsheets I saw on a fashion forum, and was really intrigued by the aspect of collecting data on something in our everyday life.
I was also inspired by early 2000s movies that portrayed "smart closets".

If I was to expand on this project in the future, I'd love to add some data visualization aspects and a way for the program to pair outfits together with picture recognition and probably a neural network or something (based on stuff like color, silhouette).

Here's what this closet web app does:
    - holds reference images for articles of clothing
    - keeps track of the cost per wear (CPW)
    - allows users to sort clothing by categories, cost, number of wears, CPW
